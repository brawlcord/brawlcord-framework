# `brawlcord-framework`

An asynchronous, modular framework for building games inspired by **Brawl Stars**.

## Overview

The `brawlcord-framework` is a modular and asynchronous framework written in **Rust** that provides core gameplay mechanics for creating simple games similar to Supercell's *Brawl Stars*. It enables developers to build customized versions of the game with ease, focusing on features like PvP battles, in-game currency systems, and player progression.
